## About me
I am an organic chemist ⚗️🧪, and a **master 2 student** in transitioning into **Data Science** 💻 at **University of Lyon 2** [Master SISE](https://www.univ-lyon2.fr/master-2-informatique-statistique-et-informatique-sise).

My background in **chemistry** and R&D has trained me to tackle complex problems, analyze data with precision, and uncover hidden patterns within highly technical datasets at the crossroads of life sciences (chemistry, biology, biochemistry…). This passion for exploration naturally led me to **Data Science**, where I strive to harness data to generate valuable insights and identify emerging trends through **statistics**, **machine learning** and **AI**.

By combining these skills with a deep understanding of life sciences, I aim to make impactful contributions to research and innovation. 📊🚀

**Search🔍, Learn📚, Optimize⚙️, Repeat🔄.**
